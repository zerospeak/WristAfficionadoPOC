# Visual Diagrams and Illustrations

This section contains the key visual diagrams and illustrations for the Luxury Watch Price Optimization System implementation. These visuals will help clarify the system architecture, data flow, and component relationships for technical personnel who may not be familiar with the technology.

## System Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the five-layer architecture of the Luxury Watch Price Optimization System, with colors indicating functional grouping:

- Yellow indicates API services and alerts
- Purple highlights visualization components
- Blue represents processing components
- Green shows data storage components
- Red indicates external data sources

## Database Entity Relationship Diagram

The entity relationship diagram shows the database structure with the following key relationships:

- Lines with crowfeet (||--o{) indicate one-to-many relationships (e.g., one WATCH can have many PRICES)
- PK indicates Primary Keys, FK indicates Foreign Keys
- PRICE_HISTORY maintains a separate table from PRICES to support blockchain verification and audit trails

## Component Interaction Flow

The component interaction flow diagram demonstrates how data moves through the system:

1. Web scraping services collect data from marketplaces
2. Data is stored in PostgreSQL database
3. Pricing engine processes data using business rules
4. ML model analyzes pricing trends
5. API services expose data to visualization layer
6. Alert system monitors for significant changes
7. Dashboard visualizes data for end-users

## Implementation Phases Visual Timeline

The implementation roadmap is divided into three phases over a 12-week period:

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)
- Basic web scraping infrastructure
- Database schema implementation
- Simple pricing engine

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)
- Advanced scraping features
- ML/NLP integration
- API development

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)
- Blockchain integration
- Visualization dashboard
- Alert system implementation
