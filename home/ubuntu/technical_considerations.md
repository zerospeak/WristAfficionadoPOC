# 5. Technical Considerations

## Scalability

The Luxury Watch Price Optimization System is designed with scalability in mind to handle growing data volumes and user loads:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - All components are containerized for easy deployment across multiple servers
   - Stateless services allow for simple load balancing
   - Database sharding strategy for large data volumes

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
   - Batch processing for large data operations

3. **Resource Management**
   - Auto-scaling configuration based on load metrics
   - Database connection pooling
   - Rate limiting for external API calls

## Reliability

To ensure system stability and data integrity:

1. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for external service calls
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failing dependencies
   - Dead letter queues for failed operations

2. **Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive health metrics for all system components
   - Automated alerting for system anomalies
   - Performance monitoring dashboards

3. **Backup Strategies**
   - Regular database backups
   - Redundant storage for critical data
   - Backup pricing strategies when primary methods fail

## Compliance

To ensure ethical and legal operation:

1. **Web Scraping Compliance**
   - Respect robots.txt files for all target websites
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading target sites
   - User-agent identification following best practices

2. **Data Protection**
   - Secure storage of all collected data
   - Encryption for sensitive information
   - Compliance with relevant data protection regulations

3. **Audit Trails**
   - Comprehensive logging of all system operations
   - Blockchain verification for price history
   - Immutable records for compliance verification
