# 2. System Architecture

## High-Level Architecture
The Luxury Watch Price Optimization System employs a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The system is organized into five functional layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer** (Yellow components)
   - Web scraping services
   - API integration services
   - Data ingestion pipelines

2. **Data Storage Layer** (Green components)
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis cache for performance optimization

3. **Processing Layer** (Blue components)
   - ML model for price prediction
   - Rule-based pricing engine
   - Blockchain verification services

4. **API Layer** (Yellow components)
   - RESTful API services
   - Alert services

5. **Visualization Layer** (Purple components)
   - Dashboard UI
   - Interactive reports

## Component Diagram
The system architecture consists of the following key components:

- **Web Scraping Service**: Collects pricing data from various marketplaces
- **Price API**: Provides access to current and historical pricing data
- **User-Agent API**: Manages rotation of user agents for web scraping
- **Redis Cache**: Stores frequently accessed data for performance
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data storage for all system entities
- **ML Model**: Processes pricing data to predict optimal pricing
- **Pricing Engine**: Applies business rules to determine final pricing
- **Blockchain Service**: Verifies and records price history for audit purposes
- **Alert System**: Monitors price changes and triggers notifications
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Provides interactive UI for data analysis

## Data Flow
Key interactions flow from top to bottom, with data flowing through the layers while maintaining loose coupling between components:

1. Web scraping services collect data from marketplaces
2. Data is stored in PostgreSQL database
3. Pricing engine processes data using business rules
4. ML model analyzes pricing trends
5. API services expose data to visualization layer
6. Alert system monitors for significant changes
7. Dashboard visualizes data for end-users
